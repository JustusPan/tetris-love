Guideline Tetris for Love2D

## Another Tetris clone?

Yes, but this one is based on the Guideline, so it has:

+ Super Rotation System (SRS)
+ Hold
+ Marathon, Sprint and Ultra
+ Consistent Tetrimino colors
+ Guideline timings

I designed this game to figure out how Guideline Tetris worked.

## How to play

First, [download Love2D](https://love2d.org).

Clone the repository.

You can use the Download as ZIP button above. Then rename the extension from `.zip` to `.love`.

**OR**

From the command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nununoisy/tetris-love
```

Now launch Love2D - either drag `tetris-love.love` onto `love.exe` or execute `love /path/to/tetris-love`

## Themes

You are free to replace the graphics contained within the `images/` subdirectory to create a custom theme.

## Contributing

Please maintain the code style. PRs are welcome.

This still needs some more stuff, like:
- [ ] 15-rotation limit for SRS on the ground
- [ ] Directions/control layout
- [ ] Button remapping
- [ ] More SFX/music

... and there's probably more stuff missing.
